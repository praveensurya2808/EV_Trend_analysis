# EV Trend Analysis

##  Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Ev_Trends.ipynb`) dedicated to analyzing trends in the electric vehicle (EV) landscape. The analysis explores key areas like adoption rates, market segmentation, technological developments, and regional variations, providing insights for stakeholders such as researchers, policymakers, and industry analysts.

##  Key Features
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Import and preprocess EV-related data (e.g., sales, registrations, battery specs, charging infrastructure).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore trends over time—global, regional, or model-specific.
- **Data Visualizations**: Generate plots such as time-series charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to reveal insights.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Analyze differences across regions, manufacturers, or vehicle types (e.g., BEV vs. PHEV).
- **Statistical Insights**: Compute metrics like growth rates, correlations, rolling trends, and summary statistics.
- **Optional Forecasting**: If included—basic forecasting models for predicting EV adoption.

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Key Libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` — data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — visualizations
  - (`scikit-learn` or `statsmodels`) — if predictive modeling or statistical inference is included
